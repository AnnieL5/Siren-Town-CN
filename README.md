# Welcome!

### What your project is/does (and what it's called)
The project is called Siren Town, story created referencing Pot Fish Chili(壶鱼辣椒)'s novel "I Became a God in a Horror Game" (我在惊悚游戏里封神).

### Why you made your project
I truly loved this story, and since it is an adventure horror story, it would look great with a different format like a visual novel where player's decision lead to different endings. Thus, I recreated this story using Renpy. 

### How you made your project
I made this project using Renpy, a truly powerful tool to create visual novels.

### What you struggled with and what you learned
Using Renpy the second time, I really learned a lot. 

One of the major challenges I faced involves the Chinese characters. /
Since this story originates from a Chinese novel, I thought it would be good to also have a Chinese version of it. 

But even with the documentations the fonts are not being displayed properly. But fortunatelly after many trying on error, I was able to resolve the problem using content from the internet and logical thinking to resolve the problem.

After this, I learned the important of perseverance, that it is possible to fix any issues and I should not give up no matter what.

### Updates
Oct. 31, 2025 
- Chinese version creates apart from the original English version
- Update to chapter twenty three
